## Introduction: The Prompt Management Dilemma

With the popularity of Large Language Models like ChatGPT and Claude, prompt engineering has become a core skill in AI application development. But as developers and prompt engineers, do you also face these challenges:

- 💾 **Prompts scattered everywhere**: Saved in various documents, notes, code comments, difficult to manage centrally
- 🔄 **Version chaos**: Unsure which is the latest version, can't find historical versions when things go wrong
- 🔍 **Hard to compare**: Unclear what changed between different versions
- 🧪 **Testing troubles**: Need to repeatedly switch and copy-paste to test different versions
- 🤖 **Optimization difficulties**: Don't know how to make prompts more effective, relying on trial and error

**Prompt Manager** is a full-stack prompt management platform built to solve these pain points. It brings professional version control concepts to prompt management, making AI development more efficient and professional.

## Quick Start: Deploy in 5 Minutes

### Prerequisites

- **Go**: 1.18 or higher
- **Node.js**: 16 or higher
- **npm** or **yarn**

### Installation Steps

#### 1. Clone the Project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cjpnice/prompt-manager.git
cd prompt-manager
```

#### 2. Method 1: One-Click Build & Deploy (Recommended)

Use the provided packaging script to automatically build the frontend and compile the backend into a single executable file:

```bash
# 1. Run build script
./build.sh

# 2. Run the application
# macOS (Choose based on your architecture)
cd build/macos-amd64 && ./prompt-manager

# Windows
# Go to build/windows-amd64 directory and run prompt-manager.exe

# Linux
# Go to build/linux-amd64 directory and run prompt-manager
```

The application will start on `http://localhost:7788`.

#### 3. Method 2: Development Mode

If you need to develop code, you can start the backend and frontend separately.

**Note**: The backend depends on frontend build artifacts. It is recommended to run `npm run build` once or manually create the dist directory in the backend folder before the first startup.


**Start Backend**

```bash
cd backend

# Install dependencies
go mod download

# Copy configuration file (Optional)
cp ../config.yaml.example config.yaml

# Start service
go run main.go
```

Backend service will start on `http://localhost:7788`.

**Start Frontend**

```bash
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

Frontend development server will start on `http://localhost:5173`.

That's it! Open your browser and visit the frontend address, your prompt management platform is running!
